# Phasor analysis for Laurdan
This is a MatLab repository which allows users to performe phasor analysis with
hyperspectral imaging with laurdan, specifically with Cilia structures.



## Demo

Given hyperspectral image data and a gift mask (where the Cilia is located) as 
input, it can be obatain the histogram distribution over the Cilia after aplying 
phasor anbalysis. These algorithm let determine up to 5 componente in the plot

Gift mask with the Cilia 

Output images, the following images show the average intensity image from each 
spectral channel. The relaxation scale normalized from 0 to 1. And the thrid one
is the Segmentated Cilia structe with its relaxation ratio.

The phasor plot let us obtain the pseudocolor image from both non relaxed and relaxed 
laurdan. Also it shows the pseudocolor image throgh the spectral phase coloring 
circle.
